# Delfin
Delfin is an experiment in encryption, hiding compressed directories inside images.

Delfin encodes .zip files into .png images of suitable size by altering the least significant bits of the color channels of each pixel in the image. The result is an image that is visually nearly identical to the original, but can be later decoded to give the original file. This renders the transmission of critical files across public spaces possible; however, someone who was in on the idea could easily decode the image themselves. To this end, Delfin offers a password-based encryption mechanic that renders it nearly impossible for an interceptor to decode a file without knowledge of the password. This ensures the critical file passes unknown beneath the noses of the masses and slips through the hands of the more curious.

Delfin is currently released as a standalone Windows Forms program. Delfin is undergoing new development currently and is not yet in its 1.0 release. Until then, the program will continue to change, often without warning. Be sure to visit the releases page for the most recent updates.

*Delfin* is German for dolphin. The name alludes to the transformation (or translation) of files. It also pays homage to Dan and Marino, the representative heads of Ekklesia, the Big Boi House.
